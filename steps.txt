Created blank angular app with following command
    ng new wg-ui-plus
    a.  Use SCSS
    b.  Use SSR

ng build

In the angular app directory, installed PrimeNG
    npm install primeng

After cloning repo, run following in the docker container to get npm modules installed

Developer environment
    Have 3 SSH terminals running and cd to the directory where the repo is cloned.
    If running for first time after cloning
        Execute ./build-dev-run-bash.sh
        In the bash shell (in the container) run following command
            cd /wg-ui-plus/app/wg-ui-plus
            npm install
            exit from the shell (and thus the container also).

    In first terminal, execute following command. This will build the Angular
    app for the first time and keep "ng" running in watch mode for any more
    changes. That's my lazy way of "ng build" :).
        ./build-dev-run-ng-build.sh

    In the second terminal, run following command. This will start the
    python-flask app which can be accessed from the browser (see the port in
    the following script file).
        ./build-dev-run-app-serve.sh

    Now in third terminal, use your favourite editor to edit the files! I use
    vim. If you are using GUI (KDE/Gnome), you don't need third terminal and
    you can use any GUI editor.

Remember: always have a branch for every new feature. The "develop" branch is
supposed to be semi-stable. But keep it stable as much as possible.
